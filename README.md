# ALX Software Engineering Projects Repository
### Repository name: alx-system_engineering-devops

## Introduction

Hello, I'm a student at ALX Software Engineering School. This repository contains my projects as part of the curriculum. The program is based on self-learning through resources and problem-solving tasks provided by the school.

**Note:** Due to the school's policy, I'm not allowed to share the specific resources or detailed task descriptions. I can only provide a brief overview or purpose of each task.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains several root directories, each representing a new project. Each project includes a number of **mandatory** and **advanced** tasks related to a new concept we are studying (***DevOps, Shell, Bash, Scripting***). The tasks are ordered by numbers (Task 0, Task 1...).

For the mandatory tasks, the filenames start from `0-filename.c` and so on. The advanced tasks start from `100-filename.c` regardless of the total number of tasks.
