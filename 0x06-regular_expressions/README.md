# Regular Expression Project

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build regular expression using Oniguruma library.  

Note: As a student at ALX Software Engineering School, and in adherence to privacy regulations and in deference to the proprietary rights of the curriculum owner, I am unable to share all the comprehensive details about the project and each task.
For more information, please refer to the README file inside the [repository](https://github.com/malhaouit/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/README.md) of this project.  

## Project Structure

This project includes 8 **mandatory** tasks and 1 **advanced** tasks.  

### Mandatory Tasks

- **Task 0:** __Simply matching School__  
	+ File: [0-simply_match_school.rb](https://github.com/malhaouit/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/0-simply_match_school.rb)  

	Requirements:  
	+ The regular expression must match `School`  
	+ Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method  

- **Task 1:** __Repetition Token #0__  
	+ File: [1-repetition_token_0.rb](https://github.com/malhaouit/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/1-repetition_token_0.rb)  

	Requirements:  
	+ Find the regular expression that will match the next cases pointed by the arrow:  
				`hbn`  
				`hbtn`  
				`hbttn`  <--  
				`hbtttn`  <--  
				`hbttttn`  <--  
				`hbtttttn`  <--  
				`hbttttttn`  

	+ Using the project instructions, create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method  

- **Task 2:** __Repetition Token #1__  
	+ File: [2-repetition_token_1.rb](https://github.com/malhaouit/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/2-repetition_token_1.rb)  

	Requirements:  
	+ Find the regular expression that will match the next cases pointed by the arrow:  
	`htn`  <--  
	`hbtn`  <--  
	`hbbtn`  
	`hbbbtn`   

- **Task: 3**  __Repetition Token #2__
	+ File: [3-repetition_token_2.rb](https://github.com/malhaouit/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/3-repetition_token_2.rb)  

	Requirements:  
	+ Find the regular expression that will match the next cases pointed by the arrow:  

	`hbn`  
	`hbtn`  <--  
	`hbttn`  <--  
	`hbtttn`  <--  
	`hbttttn`  <--  

	+ Using the project instructions, create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method  

- **Task 4:** __Repetition Token #3__
	+ File: [4-repetition_token_3.rb](https://github.com/malhaouit/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/4-repetition_token_3.rb)  

	Requirements:  
	+ Find the regular expression that will match the next cases pointed by the arrow:  
	`hbn`
	`hbon`
	`hbtn`
	`hbttn`
	`hbtttn`
	`hbttttn`
