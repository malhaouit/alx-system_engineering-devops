# Regular Expression Project

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build regular expression using Oniguruma library.  

Note: As a student at ALX Software Engineering School, and in adherence to privacy regulations and in deference to the proprietary rights of the curriculum owner, I am unable to share all the comprehensive details about the project and each task.
For more information, please refer to the README file inside the [repository](https://github.com/malhaouit/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/README.md) of this project.  

## Project Structure

This project includes 8 **mandatory** tasks and 1 **advanced** tasks.  

### Mandatory Tasks

- **Task 0:** __Simply matching School__  
	+ File: [0-simply_match_school.rb](https://github.com/malhaouit/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/0-simply_match_school.rb)  

	Requirements:  
		+ The regular expression must match `School`  
		+ Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method  

- **Task 1:** __Repetition Token #0__  
	+ File: [1-repetition_token_0.rb]()  

	Requirements:  
		+ Find the regular expression that will match the next cases:  
				 hbn  
				 hbtn  
				`hbttn`  
				`hbtttn`  
				`hbttttn`  
				`hbtttttn`  
				 hbttttttn  

		+ Using the project instructions, create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method
