# Loops, Conditions and Parsing Project

## Introduction

This project covers three important concepts in world of scripting, parsing and processing files (***loops, conditions, and parsing***). To accomplish the tasks we will need some tools like ***while*** loop, ***for*** loop, ***if*** condition and other commands that are required to accomplish the tasks of this project. It includes **11** mandatory tasks and **4** advanced tasks. 

**Note**: For more information about the privacy of this project and other related projects see the README file of the repo.

## Project Structure

### Mandatory Tasks

- **Task 0:** `Create a SSH RSA key pair`  
In this task we are asked to create a SSH RSA key pair (public key and privte key) using the command **ssh-keygen**. For more information take a look at the manual (man: ssh-keygen)

- **Task 1:** `For Best School loop`  
Write a Bash script that displays Best School 10 times.
